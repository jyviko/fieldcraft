//! FieldCraft's updates (docs/updates.md).
//!
//! - **Check** ([`net::check`]): ask the GitHub Releases API for the latest published release and
//!   compare its [`Version`] with the running one. The desktop app checks at start-up at most
//!   once a day ([`due`]) when the user leaves automatic checks on, and from Help › Check for
//!   Updates; `app.update.check` and `fieldcraft-cli update --check` run the same check.
//! - **Verify** ([`verify`]): a release's `SHA256SUMS.txt` must carry a signature by the release
//!   key ([`PUBLIC_KEY`], Ed25519 in minisign's format), and the downloaded asset must have the
//!   SHA-256 that list gives it. Anything else is refused; an unsigned release can only be
//!   downloaded by hand from its page.
//! - **Install** ([`install`], [`stage`]): how this copy is installed decides the asset and the
//!   swap. The verified release is unpacked beside the install and swapped in by renames
//!   (after the window closes, for the app), or, for `.deb`/`.rpm`, handed to the system's
//!   package manager.
//!
//! Downloading and unpacking are native only: the browser build has the pure parts (versions,
//! releases, plans), and the web app updates through its service worker.
